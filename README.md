# Cache-Simulator
A simulator to model a caching system with 2C bytes of data storage, having 2B-byte, and with sets of 2S blocks per set (note that S=0 is a direct-mapped cache, and S = C - B is a fully associative cache).

1. /src contains the project that will work on a linux machine.
2. /simulations contains a python script to run simulations and create logs used for project report.
3. /docs contains project report contains incorporating the analysis and the answers to cache dimensions.
